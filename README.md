Portfolio is the ideal fit for this repository, which is essentially Saran Industries' main business website.

AI automation software co-authored the styles.css and index.html files.  The initial source code for the website was written using AI software after it was first developed in Figma.  This project is 95% comparable to what I designed in Figma because I utilised AI to co-author the CSS file and further adjusted the HTML to my specifications.  The complete project, including Figma design, AI data imports and exports, AI source code modifications, troubleshooting, and deployment, took about six work hours.
